An autonomous AI agent that:

Analyzes energy consumption datasets for data quality issues
Detects anomalies, missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies
Uses open-source LLMs (locally or free APIs) to reason through problems
Generates natural language explanations and fixes
Creates an automated workflow that requires minimal human intervention

Core Components:
Component 1: Anomaly Detection Engine

Analyzes time-series energy data
Identifies statistical outliers
Detects missing values and duplicates
Flags inconsistent patterns (e.g., negative consumption)

Component 2: LLM Reasoning Agent

Uses free/open-source LLM to explain anomalies
Generates human-readable insights
Suggests data cleaning strategies
Provides step-by-step reasoning

Component 3: RAG System (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Vector database of energy data documentation
LLM queries documentation for context
Provides domain-specific cleaning recommendations

Component 4: Automated Cleaning Workflow

Agent generates Python code to fix issues
Executes cleaning operations
Logs all changes for audit trail
Creates before/after comparison reports

Component 5: Simple Web Interface
