# Energy Data Quality Guidelines

## Valid Consumption Values
- Residential: 0-50 kWh/hour typical
- Commercial: 0-500 kWh/hour typical  
- Industrial: 0-5000 kWh/hour typical
- Negative values are INVALID (consumption cannot be negative)
- Zero values may indicate meter offline or non-operational periods

## Common Data Quality Issues

### Missing Values
Causes: Meter communication failures, transmission errors, power outages
Solutions:
- Short gaps (<2 hours): Forward-fill from last known value
- Medium gaps (2-6 hours): Linear interpolation
- Long gaps (>6 hours): Mark as unreliable, may need manual inspection
- NEVER backfill consumption data (violates causality)

### Outliers
Definition: Values >3 standard deviations from mean
Causes:
- Equipment startup (sudden spike)
- Data logging errors  
- Unit conversion mistakes (Wh recorded as kWh = 1000x error)
- Meter malfunction
Detection: Compare with temperature, check equipment logs
Solution: Cap at 3*std or replace with median

### Unit Inconsistencies
Standard: kWh (kilowatt-hours)
Common error: Wh (watt-hours) as kWh
Detection: Values exactly 1000x expected range
Solution: Divide by 1000

### Duplicate Timestamps
Causes: Database sync issues, daylight saving time transitions
Solution: Keep first occurrence, remove rest

### Negative Values
These are ALWAYS invalid for consumption data
Causes: Meter errors, data corruption, incorrect sensor calibration
Solution: Remove or replace with NaN

### Zero Values
May be valid (building closed) or invalid (meter offline)
Validation: Check if sustained (>4 hours) or isolated
Solution: Validate against building schedule

## Seasonal Patterns
- Summer (Jun-Aug): Higher due to cooling
- Winter (Dec-Feb): Higher due to heating
- Spring/Fall: Lower baseline
- Sudden breaks in patterns indicate quality issues

## Data Validation Rules
1. Consumption ≥ 0 (no negative values)
2. Sequential timestamps with ≤1 hour gaps
3. Values within 3σ unless justified
4. No duplicate timestamps
5. Temperature correlation check
